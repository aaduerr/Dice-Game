# Dice-Game
Wrote this in java when I was learning for fun a while back. The objective of the game is to get as few numbers as possible. You start with 1-9 and you can use as many as you want to add up to your roll. Roll something you can't produce with your numbers and the game is over. Also, enter each number one at a time.
